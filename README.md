Creating a well-structured and informative README is essential for sharing your project with others. Here's a template for a README specific to your car brand prediction model using ResNet50:

# Car Brand Prediction Model using ResNet50

![Model Demo](demo.gif) (Replace with a link to a demo video or a screenshot)

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for predicting car brands based on input images. It leverages the powerful ResNet50 architecture to achieve high accuracy in classifying various car brands. This README provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and how to use the model for predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- A dataset of car images labeled with their respective brands

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fortunatetech/Vehicle-Brand-Prediction-Deep-Learning-Project-with-Deployment.git
   cd car-brand-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:

   - Organize your car images into labeled folders (e.g., "Toyota," "Ford," "Honda," etc.).

2. Train the model:

   - Modify the `config.py` file to set the appropriate parameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and dataset paths.

   - Run the training script:

     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

3. Make predictions:

   - Use the trained model to predict car brands from input images:

     ```python
     from predict import predict_car_brand

     image_path = "path/to/your/input/image.jpg"
     predicted_brand = predict_car_brand(image_path)
     print(f"The predicted car brand is: {predicted_brand}")
     ```

## Model Training

- Explain the dataset used, data preprocessing steps, and any data augmentation techniques employed.
- Provide information on model architecture and hyperparameters used for training.
- Mention any challenges encountered during training and how they were addressed.

## Evaluation

- Describe how the model's performance was evaluated, including metrics used (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
- Provide insights into the model's performance and any potential areas for improvement.

## Demo

- Include a GIF or video demonstrating how to use the model for predictions, showcasing its accuracy and speed.
